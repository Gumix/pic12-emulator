# pic12-emulator
[PIC12 microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller) emulator written in 2007 by our group during Computer Architecture class.

I've created the framework, and the rest of the group implemented all instructions and corresponding tests.

[README_RUS.md](README_RUS.md) contains a description (in Russian) written by Kate.
